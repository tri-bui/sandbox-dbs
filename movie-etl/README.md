# Movie Data ETL Pipeline

This is an extract-transform-load (ETL) pipeline for movie data from Wikipedia and the Open Movie Database (OMDB). The data was scraped from Wikipedia and the OMDB data was downloaded from Kaggle. As the name suggests, this movie data was extracted from flat files, cleaned and transformed, and loaded into a PostgreSQL database.
