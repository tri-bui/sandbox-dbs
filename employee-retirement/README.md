# Employee Retirement Analysis

This miniproject explores creating a SQL database and tables using PostgreSQL. The data being used is fictional company data consisting of 6 datasets (described in the data section below). The following steps outline the workflow of this project:
1. Create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) with QuickDBD to visualize the data schema
2. Create a new database on pgAdmin
3. Create empty tables for each of the 6 datasets based on the schema
4. Import the 6 data files into the corresponding table just created
5. Perform an analysis (described in the analysis section below) on the data using SQL queries and save the results as new tables
6. Export new tables to CSV files
